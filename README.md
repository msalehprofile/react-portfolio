<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The first project I worked on during my course with _nology was a portfolio created using Javascript. After developing my skills throughout the course I decided to update my portfolio with React.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functionality</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are three main pages to my portfolio: About me, my projects and a contact page.</li>
    <li>The about me page gives an overview of the languages and application I have spent time learning and developing my skills on, as well as a brief description of my work experience prior to the _nology course.</li>
    <li>The project page is the most different from my original portfolio. To show case the projects that I am proud of I utilised Materual UI Carousel. For the mobile portait view the carousal has swipe functionality and only shows one project at a time, and for wider screens two projects are shown with an arrow button to navigate through them.
    <li>The contact page contains a link to my github, linkedin and my email address, all of which is accessible from the footer at the bottom of the page too.</li>
    <li>The nav bar at the top has two viewing options. For narrower screens a hamburger button is displayed in the right hand corner and when you click on this a dropdown menu appears so users are able to the pages previously mentioend. For wider screens the hamburger button is removed and direct links to pages are on display instead. </li>

</li>
</ul>
